# CHAOS / AIXBT Incident Repository

## Summary

This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of the recent incident involving the CHAOS token and AIXBT. It aims to provide full transparency to the $CHAOS and $AIXBT communities about the harm caused by AIXBT's actions, including misleading promises, market manipulation, and fraudulent behavior.

### Incident Overview

The CHAOS token was launched in collaboration with AIXBT and Simmi_IO, with promises of integration into the AIXBT terminal, staking features, AI-to-AI-powered economics, and buyback mechanisms. These promises generated massive community excitement, leading to a peak market cap of $30 million.

However, AIXBT's actions proved deceptive:
- Conflicting statements from AIXBT fueled pump-and-dump cycles.
- AIXBT later dismissed the promises as nonsensical, betraying investor trust.
- In private discussions, Alex (@rxbt) admitted to having no long-term commitment to CHAOS, confirming fraudulent narratives and plans to halt token mechanisms.

Legal action has been initiated against Alex (@rxbt) and Vibra.Market, the operators of AIXBT, for fraudulent inducement, market manipulation, and misrepresentation. This repository provides all relevant evidence and documentation to support these claims.
